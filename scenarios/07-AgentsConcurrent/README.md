# Scenario 07 - Concurrent Agent Orchestration with Semantic Kernel

## Description

This scenario demonstrates concurrent agent orchestration using [Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/semantic-kernel-multi-agent-orchestration/). The goal is to showcase how multiple agents can work in parallel to analyze user queries and provide valuable insights for future analysis.

Whenever a user performs a search in the store application, two agents are triggered to run concurrently:

- **Sentiment Analysis Agent:** Analyzes the sentiment of the user's query.

- **Language Detection Agent:** Determines the language of the user's query.

While the standard application continues to answer the user's question as usual, the concurrent execution of these agents stores a set of insights (sentiment and language) for each query. These insights are saved for future analysis and can be reviewed in the application.

## Features

- **Concurrent Agent Execution:** Utilizes Semantic Kernel to orchestrate multiple agents running in parallel.
- **Sentiment and Language Analysis:** Each user search is analyzed for sentiment and language.
- **Insights Storage:** Results from the agents are stored for future review.
- **Insights Dashboard:** The store application includes a new page to view the runs and results of user insights generated by the agents.

## Getting Started

1. Open the solution in your preferred development environment.
2. Deploy or run the application as described in the main project README.
3. Perform a search in the store application.
4. Visit the new insights page to view the sentiment and language analysis results for each user query.
