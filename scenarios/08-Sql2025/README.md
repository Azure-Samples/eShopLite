## Getting Started

## Main Concepts in this Scenario

This scenario demonstrates how to use [SQL Server 2025's Vector search and Vector index features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/vectors/vectors-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17) in a .NET Aspire application. The main concepts and implementation details are:

- The .NET Aspire AppHost project creates the SQL Server 2025 instance directly using the container image `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2025-latest` from the Docker repository for SQL Server 2025: [Microsoft SQL Server - Ubuntu based images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server/).

- The logic for initializing and running the SQL Server container is implemented in [`scenarios/08-Sql2025/src/eShopAppHost/Program.cs`](scenarios/08-Sql2025/src/eShopAppHost/Program.cs):

    ```csharp
    var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    
    var sql = builder.AddSqlServer("sql")
        .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)
        .WithImageTag("2025-latest")
        .WithEnvironment("ACCEPT_EULA", "Y");
    
    var productsDb = sql
        .WithDataVolume()
        .AddDatabase("productsDb");
    
    var products = builder.AddProject<Projects.Products>("products")
        .WithReference(productsDb)
        .WaitFor(productsDb);    
    ```

- Using an embedding client, once the database is initialized and a set of sample products is added, a new vector field is completed using an embedding. This logic is in [`scenarios/08-Sql2025/src/Products/Models/DbInitializer.cs`](./src/Products/Models/DbInitializer.cs).

- The `ProductApiActions` class ([`scenarios/08-Sql2025/src/Products/Endpoints/ProductApiActions.cs`](./src/Products/Endpoints/ProductApiActions.cs)) implements an `AISearch()` function that performs semantic search using [EFCore.SqlServer.VectorSearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.SqlServer.VectorSearch/9.0.0-preview.2#show-readme-container) functions:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task<IResult> AISearch(string search, Context db, EmbeddingClient embeddingClient, int dimensions = 1536)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Querying for similar products...");
    
        var embeddingSearch = embeddingClient.GenerateEmbedding(search, new() { Dimensions = dimensions });
        var vectorSearch = embeddingSearch.Value.ToFloats().ToArray();
        var products = await db.Product
            .OrderBy(p => EF.Functions.VectorDistance("cosine", p.Embedding, vectorSearch))
            .Take(3)
            .ToListAsync();
    
        var response = new SearchResponse
        {
            Products = products,
            Response = products.Count > 0 ?
                $"{products.Count} Products found for [{search}]" :
                $"No products found for [{search}]"
        };
        return Results.Ok(response);
    }
    ```

These components work together to enable semantic search over product data using SQL Server 2025's vector capabilities.

The solution is in the `./src` folder, the main solution is **[eShopLite-Sql2025.slnx](./src/eShopLite-Sql2025.slnx)**.

## Deploying

> **Note:** The deployment process for this scenario is the same as in [scenario 01 - Semantic Search](../01-SemanticSearch/README.md). Please refer to the [Deploying](../01-SemanticSearch/README.md#deploying) section in that README for detailed steps and requirements. All Azure resource provisioning, local development, and Codespaces instructions are identical for this scenario.

## Guidance

### Costs

For **Azure OpenAI Services**, pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.
However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/2176802ea14941e4959eae8ad335aeb5) for the resources:

- Azure OpenAI Service: S0 tier, gpt-4.1-mini and text-embedding-3-small models. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure Container App: Consumption tier with 0.5 CPU, 1GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
- Azure Container Registry: Basic tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
- Log analytics: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)
- Azure Application Insights pricing is based on a Pay-As-You-Go model. [Pricing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs).

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use, either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security Guidelines

Samples in this templates uses Azure OpenAI Services with ApiKey and [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authenticating to the Azure OpenAI service.

The Main Sample uses Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authenticating to the Azure OpenAI service.

Additionally, we have added a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action) that scans the infrastructure-as-code files and generates a report containing any detected issues. To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

- Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
