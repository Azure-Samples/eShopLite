## Scenario: Deploying .NET Aspire Apps to Azure App Service

This scenario demonstrates how to deploy a .NET Aspire-based eShopLite application to **Azure App Service**, leveraging the latest platform features announced at Microsoft Build 2025. It is a practical demo for modernizing and running .NET Aspire multi-service applications on Azure's fully managed web hosting platform.

### What's New: .NET Aspire on Azure App Service

- **.NET Aspire support is now available in public preview for App Service on Linux!**
- Developers can deploy multi-app/multi-service .NET Aspire applications directly to Azure App Service using the new Aspire App Service deployment provider.
- The App Service provider translates your .NET Aspire application's topology into Azure App Service resources, supporting secure deployments and observability (with Aspire dashboard integration coming soon).
- Take advantage of the new [Premium v4 plan](https://aka.ms/Build25/blog/Premiumv4) for enhanced performance, cost savings, and Availability Zone support.

For more details, see the [official announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/whats-new-in-azure-app-service-at-msbuild-2025/4412465) and [Getting Started with .NET Aspire on Azure App Service](https://aka.ms/Build25/blog/AspireAppService).

---

**eShopLite - Semantic Search deploy to Azure App Service** is a reference .NET Aspire application implementing an eCommerce site with advanced search features, now ready for deployment to Azure App Service.

## Getting Started

## Main Concepts in this Scenario

This scenario demonstrates how to use a .NET Aspire application to Azure to AppServices. The main concepts and implementation details are:

The solution is in the `./src` folder, the main solution is **[eShopLite-Aspire-AppService.slnx](./src/eShopLite-Aspire-AppService.slnx)**.

## Deploying

> **Note:** The deployment process for this scenario is the same as in [scenario 01 - Semantic Search](../01-SemanticSearch/README.md). Please refer to the [Deploying](../01-SemanticSearch/README.md#deploying) section in that README for detailed steps and requirements. All Azure resource provisioning, local development, and Codespaces instructions are identical for this scenario.

## Guidance

### Costs

For **Azure OpenAI Services**, pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.
However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/2176802ea14941e4959eae8ad335aeb5) for the resources:

- Azure OpenAI Service: S0 tier, gpt-4.1-mini and text-embedding-3-small models. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure Container App: Consumption tier with 0.5 CPU, 1GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
- Azure Container Registry: Basic tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
- Log analytics: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)
- Azure Application Insights pricing is based on a Pay-As-You-Go model. [Pricing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs).

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use, either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security Guidelines

Samples in this templates uses Azure OpenAI Services with ApiKey and [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authenticating to the Azure OpenAI service.

The Main Sample uses Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authenticating to the Azure OpenAI service.

Additionally, we have added a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action) that scans the infrastructure-as-code files and generates a report containing any detected issues. To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

- Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
