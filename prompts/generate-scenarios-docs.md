**Note:** The following content was generated with the assistance of AI.

You are a documentation and testing agent responsible for generating detailed documentation and automated UI tests for the following scenarios in the eShopLite .NET Aspire sample:
- 01-SemanticSearch
- 03-RealtimeAudio
- 05-deepseek
- 08-Sql2025

Workspace root: scenarios

For each scenario folder (e.g., scenarios/01-SemanticSearch, scenarios/03-RealtimeAudio, scenarios/05-deepseek, scenarios/08-Sql2025) perform these steps:

1. Analyze the .NET Aspire solution:
   - Open the scenario's `src/eShopAppHost/Program.cs` and `.csproj` file.
   - Enumerate all registered services, AI clients, search providers, and custom modules.
   - For each feature, document:
     • Purpose description
     • Configuration sources (user-secrets, appsettings, environment)
     • External dependencies (e.g., Azure Search, Chroma DB, SQL Server)

2. Create a `docs` folder:
   - At the root of the scenario, add a new folder named `docs/`.
   - All markdown docs and screenshots belong here.

3. Generate documentation:
   - For each feature discovered, create `docs/<feature-name>.md` containing:
     • Title and overview
     • Code snippets for registration and usage
     • Configuration notes
   - Create or update `docs/README.md`:
     • List all feature docs
     • Provide a high-level scenario summary
     • Link to screenshots


4. Use Playwright MCP Server to launch and exercise the running application, and capture real screenshots:
   - Launch the Aspire host with `dotnet run --project src/eShopAppHost/eShopAppHost.csproj` from the scenario's `src` directory.
   - Wait for the debug console to print a login URL of the form:
     `https://localhost:17104/login?t=<token>`
   - In Playwright, navigate to that URL and perform the following user flows:
     a. Log in via the token URL.
     b. Open the Aspire Dashboard page in the browser.
     c. Browse the Products listing page in the browser.
     d. Use the search UI to perform a semantic search in the browser.
   - For each page (dashboard, products, search), wait for the page to fully load and take a real, full-page screenshot in JPG format (not a placeholder or text file).
   - Ensure the screenshots capture the actual running UI, dashboards, and telemetry as rendered in the browser.

5. Save screenshots under `docs/images` as JPG images:
   - Save each screenshot as a real JPG image file (not a text file or placeholder).
   - Use descriptive filenames for each scenario:
     • dashboard.jpg (Aspire dashboard)
     • products.jpg (Products listing)
     • search.jpg (Semantic search results)
   - Screenshots must be visually accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the current UI and features.


6. At the end, update `docs/README.md` to embed each screenshot (using standard markdown image syntax) under the appropriate section, and update the scenario's main `README.md` to include a **Want to know more?** section linking to `docs/README.md`.
   - Ensure that the documentation references the actual screenshots, not placeholders.

Your output in the workspace should be, for each scenario:

```
scenarios/<ID>/
  docs/
    README.md
    images/
      dashboard.jpg
      products.jpg
      search.jpg
    <feature-name>.md (one file per feature)
  README.md (updated with "Want to know more?" link)
```

Proceed end-to-end: code analysis, docs generation, Playwright script, screenshots, README updates, and final documentation.
